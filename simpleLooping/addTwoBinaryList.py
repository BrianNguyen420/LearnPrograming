# Create a function that takes two binary lists as input.
# The function should return the sum of the two binary numbers as a binary list.
# The result list should have the same length as the longer input list.
# If we need one more element to store the extra carry value, then append it at the end of the list.
# If the input does not represent two binary lists, return -1.
# Ex:
#   addTwoBinaryList([1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1]) # return [0, 1, 1, 1]
#   addTwoBinaryList([1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1]) # return [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
