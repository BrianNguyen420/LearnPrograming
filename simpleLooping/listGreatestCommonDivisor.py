# Create a function that takes a list of integers as input.
# Return the Greatest Common Divisor of them using Euclidean algorithm.
# Return -1 if at least two integers are zeros as GCD(0, 0) is undefined.
# Ex:
#   listGreatestCommonDivisor(-42, 402, -66, 354, 78, 426) # return 6
#   listGreatestCommonDivisor(7883933, 91928167, 54151651) # return 1
