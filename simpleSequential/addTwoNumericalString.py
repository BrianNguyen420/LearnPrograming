# Note: Sometime we want to add two strings that represent number together. 
#       It can be done using multiple build in functions.
#
# Create a function that take two strings that represent two numbers.
# Return a string that represent the sum of those two numbers represent by the input strings.
# Assume that the input strings can be represent as valid numbers.
# Ex:
#   addTwoNumericalString("321", "-21") # return "300"
#   addTwoNumericalString("042", "-42") # return "0"
