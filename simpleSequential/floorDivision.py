# Note: When making division, you will receive a float not an integer.
#         Ex:
#           print(4 / 2) # Displayed 2.0 not 2
#           pintt(9 / 2) # Displayed 4.5 not 4
#       But you might only need the integer part. It can be done using a build in floor division operator.
#
# Create a function that take two integer variables `dividend` and `divisor`.
# Return an integer which is the result of the floor division when `dividend` is divided by `divisor`.
# Ex:
#   floorDivision(18, 3) # return 6
#   floorDivision(19, 4) # return 4
